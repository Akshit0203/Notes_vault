# 📘 Obsidian Notes Vault

This repository contains my personal learning notes created inside Obsidian, covering cybersecurity, networking, programming fundamentals, cloud concepts, and other technical subjects.

All notes are written while practicing real labs, hands-on exercises, CTF-style learning, and certification preparation.

> This repo serves as a personal knowledge base and revision resource.
> It may also help beginners explore structured learning materials.
