In this lesson I introduce service control policies - a feature of AWS Organizations which allow restrictions to be placed on MEMBER accounts in the form of boundaries.

SCPs can be applied to the organization, to OU's or to individual accounts.

Member accounts can be effected, the MANAGEMENT account cannot.

SCPs DON'T GIVE permission - they just control what an account CAN and CANNOT grant via identity policies.
