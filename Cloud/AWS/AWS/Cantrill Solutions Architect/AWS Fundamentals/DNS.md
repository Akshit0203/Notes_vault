why do we even need registrar , why cant i buy directly from registry
ChatGPT said:
That's a smart question! Technically, you could buy a domain directly from a Registry, but the reason we have Registrars in the middle comes down to scalability, specialization, and user convenience. Here's why the system works this way:

1️⃣ Registries Focus on Backend Operations, Not Sales
Registries like Verisign (.com), PIR (.org), or Nominet (.uk) are mainly responsible for maintaining the DNS infrastructure and keeping the TLD operational.
They focus on technical aspects, like ensuring domain resolution works and that the DNS servers stay up and running worldwide.
Selling domains to millions of customers directly would require customer support, billing systems, marketing, and security measures—which is not their primary role.
2️⃣ Registrars Handle Sales, Support, and Services
Registrars (like GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.) specialize in selling domains to end-users.
They provide a user-friendly interface, making it easy for people to search for, buy, and manage domain names.
They offer additional services like:
Web hosting
Email hosting
SSL certificates
Domain privacy protection
DNS management tools
Without Registrars, every customer would have to interact directly with a Registry’s technical backend, which could be complex.
3️⃣ ICANN Policy Requires Registrars for Fair Competition
If Registries sold directly, they could create a monopoly, setting whatever price they want for domains.
ICANN enforces a rule that most Registries cannot sell domains directly to users—they must go through ICANN-accredited Registrars.
This creates a competitive market, keeping prices fair and preventing any one Registry from exploiting customers.
4️⃣ Registrars Make Domain Transfers and Renewals Easier
With multiple Registrars, you can transfer your domain from one to another if you find a better price or better services.
If Registries sold domains directly, switching providers would be much harder.
5️⃣ Some Registries DO Sell Directly (But Only in Limited Cases)
Some smaller Registries do sell domains directly, usually for country-code TLDs (ccTLDs) or specialty TLDs.
Example: Nominet (the registry for .uk domains) allows direct registrations.
Example: Google Domains (now owned by Squarespace) acts as both a Registrar and a Registry for some domains.
However, for major TLDs like .com, .org, or .net, you must go through a Registrar.
Key Takeaways:
✅ Registries focus on managing the TLD’s infrastructure, not direct sales.
✅ Registrars handle customer support, billing, and additional services, making domain management easier.
✅ ICANN’s rules enforce a Registry-Registrar separation to prevent monopolies and encourage fair pricing.
✅ Some Registries sell domains directly, but this is rare and usually only for country-code TLDs or specialty domains.

so after icann gives permission to registries , why do these registreis charge money
ChatGPT said:
Great question! After ICANN delegates control of a Top-Level Domain (TLD) to a Registry, the Registry charges money for domain registrations for several important reasons:

1️⃣ Operating and Maintaining the Registry Infrastructure
A Registry is responsible for running and maintaining the central database that stores all domain names for a specific TLD (e.g., .com, .net). The Registry also manages the DNS infrastructure required to ensure that websites under that TLD are accessible. These operations are resource-intensive and require significant investment in technology, hardware, and staff.

Costs involved include:
Hardware and Software: Servers and databases to store and manage domain name registrations, DNS records, etc.
DNS resolution: Ensuring that every query for a .com domain (like google.com) is routed to the correct server.
24/7 operational uptime: Ensuring reliability and minimizing downtime for the domains under that TLD.
2️⃣ Security and Stability of the Domain System
The Registry plays a vital role in ensuring the security, stability, and resilience of the domain system. They handle:

DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions): A set of protocols to protect the DNS from attacks like cache poisoning.
DDoS protection: Defending against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks that could impact the availability of domains.
Data integrity: Ensuring that data about domain registrations is accurate and protected from unauthorized access or tampering.
These security measures come with a high cost to implement and maintain.

3️⃣ Regulatory Compliance and ICANN Fees
ICANN has specific rules and agreements that Registries must comply with. Registries are required to:

Pay fees to ICANN: ICANN charges a fee for each domain that a Registry registers. For example, Verisign pays ICANN a fee for each .com domain it registers.
Example: Verisign pays ICANN a \$0.18 fee for each .com domain registered, on top of other operational costs.
Adhere to compliance: Registries must comply with ICANN’s policies, such as rules about domain transfers, WHOIS data, and privacy regulations.
These compliance requirements often necessitate the hiring of legal and technical experts to ensure the Registry stays up-to-date with global internet governance.

4️⃣ Registrar-Registry Agreements
While Registries set the base price for domains under their TLDs, they also have agreements with Registrars (companies that sell domains, like GoDaddy or Namecheap). These agreements govern the prices at which the Registrars can sell domains to end-users.

Registries charge Registrars a wholesale fee for each domain registration.
Registrars, in turn, charge retail prices (which can be much higher than the wholesale fee) to cover their operational costs and make a profit.
For example:

Verisign might charge \$7.85 per .com domain to a Registrar.
The Registrar might then sell the domain for \$10, \$15, or more to the customer.
5️⃣ Profit and Business Sustainability
As with any business, a Registry also aims to make a profit. The revenue from domain registrations helps Registries sustain their operations, expand their infrastructure, and continue investing in security and technology to keep the DNS system robust.

Why Do Registries Charge for Domains?
Covering infrastructure costs (servers, DNS, databases).
Providing security and stability for domain resolution.
Complying with ICANN policies and paying fees.
Facilitating Registrar relationships by charging a wholesale price.
Sustaining the business and earning a profit.
Key Takeaways:
Registries charge money for domains to cover the costs of infrastructure, security, and compliance with ICANN.
They charge Registrars a wholesale price, and Registrars in turn sell the domains to end-users at a higher price.
ICANN fees, operational expenses, and business sustainability contribute to the pricing of domains.

how did these registries get the domain
ChatGPT said:
Great question! The process of how Registries get control over certain Top-Level Domains (TLDs) involves a combination of ICANN policies, public-private agreements, and technical expertise. Here's how it works in detail:

How Registries Get Control Over TLDs:
1️⃣ ICANN Delegates Control of TLDs

ICANN, as the global authority for the Domain Name System (DNS), is responsible for managing the root zone of the DNS, which contains the list of all TLDs (like .com, .net, .org, .uk, etc.).
ICANN delegates control of each TLD to a Registry. This means ICANN allows specific organizations or entities to manage and maintain the authoritative database of domains for a given TLD.
2️⃣ Application Process for a New TLD (Generic or Country Code)

When an entity wants to become a Registry for a new TLD, they must go through an application process with ICANN.
This process is typically called the New gTLD Program (generic Top-Level Domains) or ccTLD Process (for country-code TLDs like .uk, .in).
During this process, entities must demonstrate that they have the technical, operational, and financial capacity to run a TLD registry.
Example:

Verisign applied to manage .com and .net in the late 1990s and was granted this role by ICANN.
Afilias (now part of Donuts) was granted control of the .org registry.
3️⃣ Registry-Registrar Agreement

Once a Registry is granted control over a TLD, it must enter into agreements with Registrars to sell domains under that TLD.
For example, Verisign manages .com but allows companies like GoDaddy, Namecheap, and others to sell .com domains to end-users.
Registrars interact with the Registry’s central database, making sure the domain name is available and then registering it on behalf of the user.
4️⃣ Operational and Financial Responsibilities

Registries have several key responsibilities:
Maintaining the database: The Registry keeps an authoritative database of all registered domains for the TLD (e.g., a list of all registered .com domains).
Managing DNS infrastructure: The Registry ensures that the DNS for its TLD is up and running, so users can access websites with that domain (e.g., example.com).
Setting pricing and policies: While ICANN sets some rules, the Registry also has flexibility in setting pricing, renewal rates, and some registration policies.
5️⃣ ICANN’s Role in Renewal and Oversight

ICANN doesn't directly manage the day-to-day operations of each TLD. However, it maintains oversight of how Registries operate.
ICANN typically enters into contracts with Registries, specifying how the Registry should operate (e.g., how the data is stored, how prices are set, etc.). ICANN can renew these contracts if the Registry is performing according to standards, or it can revoke control if necessary.
Example of a TLD Registration Process:
Let’s take the example of Verisign managing .com:

ICANN delegates control of .com to Verisign based on an agreement.
Verisign maintains the central registry for .com, storing a list of all registered domain names (like google.com, yahoo.com).
GoDaddy (a Registrar) wants to sell domains like example.com to users.
GoDaddy queries Verisign to check if example.com is available.
If it's available, GoDaddy registers example.com in Verisign's central database.
The user now owns example.com, and GoDaddy provides them with services like web hosting and DNS management.
Why Do Registries Exist?
Registries manage TLDs to ensure stability and security of the DNS for each TLD.
They set policies (like domain renewal rates and registration rules) and ensure domains are properly resolved on the internet.
They interface with Registrars to ensure domains can be easily sold and transferred to users.
Key Takeaways:
ICANN delegates control over TLDs (like .com, .net) to Registries through a formal process.
Registries like Verisign and Afilias maintain central databases for TLDs and are responsible for DNS management.
Registrars (like GoDaddy) sell domains to users but rely on the Registry to register those domains in their central databases.

who manages icann
ChatGPT said:
ICANN (the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) is not directly managed by any single individual or organization, but instead operates as a multi-stakeholder organization. It is overseen by a board of directors and is accountable to a wide range of stakeholders, including governments, businesses, technical experts, and users.

Here’s a breakdown of how ICANN is governed and managed:

1️⃣ ICANN’s Board of Directors
The Board of Directors is responsible for ICANN’s overall governance and policy decisions. It is composed of 16 voting members and 9 non-voting members, including representatives from different geographic regions and stakeholder groups.

Chairman: The Board elects a Chairman and other officers to manage meetings and decisions.
Members: Board members include representatives from civil society, technical organizations, businesses, and governments. This reflects ICANN's commitment to a global, multi-stakeholder approach.
2️⃣ ICANN’s Organizational Structure
ICANN’s operations are carried out by various departments and teams, with different responsibilities:

Policy and Technical Committees: Groups of experts and stakeholders that advise the Board on policy issues and technical standards.
At-Large Advisory Committee (ALAC): Represents individual Internet users and advises the Board.
Government Advisory Committee (GAC): Provides advice to the Board from governments and public authorities.
Supporting Organizations: These include groups that focus on specific areas of the DNS:
Generic Names Supporting Organization (GNSO): Works on generic TLD policies.
Country Code Names Supporting Organization (ccNSO): Works on country-code TLD policies.
Address Supporting Organization (ASO): Deals with IP address policy.
3️⃣ ICANN’s Accountability and Transparency
ICANN’s structure is designed to be transparent and accountable to its global stakeholders, and its decisions are made with input from these different groups. It follows a bottom-up, consensus-driven model, meaning that ICANN works with all interested parties to ensure decisions are made collaboratively.

4️⃣ The U.S. Government’s Role (Historical Context)
Until October 1, 2016, ICANN was overseen by the U.S. Department of Commerce through the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), which had a contractual relationship with ICANN. However, ICANN transitioned to a fully independent model in 2016, taking the U.S. government out of the direct governance role.

Post-2016: The transition marked a shift toward global accountability, with ICANN now being governed by a multi-stakeholder model with no single controlling government.
5️⃣ ICANN’s Funding
ICANN is funded primarily by fees collected from registrars and registries, as well as from contractual services like domain name registrations, renewals, and transfers. It does not receive funding from any specific government, although it does engage with governments for advice and consultation.

Key Takeaways:
ICANN is governed by a Board of Directors that includes representatives from many stakeholder groups.
It operates under a multi-stakeholder model, meaning businesses, governments, and technical experts all have a say in its decision-making.
Historically, ICANN was overseen by the U.S. government, but in 2016, it became fully independent.

so icann does not own anything , it is just a regulatory body
ChatGPT said:
Exactly! ICANN (the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) is a non-profit organization that acts as the global regulatory body for the Domain Name System (DNS), but it does not own any domains or operate registries. Its role is more about governance, coordination, and policy-making rather than owning or managing domain names.

ICANN's Role:
1️⃣ Governance of the DNS

ICANN oversees the overall structure of the Domain Name System (DNS) to ensure that the system works efficiently and globally.
It coordinates the allocation of domain names and IP addresses to ensure no conflicts.
2️⃣ Accrediting and Managing Registries and Registrars

ICANN accredits and licenses Registries (e.g., Verisign for .com, Afilias for .org) and Registrars (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap) to manage and sell domain names.
Registries are responsible for the centralized database of domain names under a TLD (e.g., .com, .net).
Registrars sell domain names to users and handle registration requests.
3️⃣ Root Zone Management

ICANN manages the root zone of the DNS, which is the very top of the DNS hierarchy, ensuring that all Top-Level Domains (TLDs) like .com, .org, .net are properly listed and accessible.
4️⃣ Policy Development

ICANN develops and sets policies for the DNS and domain name system, like how TLDs are operated and how domain names can be transferred, etc.
5️⃣ Global Coordination

ICANN works with governments, businesses, and technical experts to ensure the global stability, security, and growth of the DNS.
What ICANN Does NOT Do:
Owns domains: ICANN does not own domains or operate TLDs directly. Registries (like Verisign) are responsible for operating TLDs.
Sells domains: ICANN doesn’t sell domain names to end-users. That’s the role of Registrars.
Manages individual domain records: ICANN doesn't directly manage individual domain records (e.g., [www.example.com](http://www.example.com)). Registrars and Registries handle that.
In Summary:
ICANN sets the rules and coordinates the global DNS system but does not own or operate domains.
The Registries manage TLDs (like .com) and maintain the central databases of domains under those TLDs.
The Registrars are the ones who sell domains to end-users like you and me.

but earlier there only only icann and the registrar , now how did verisign come in between
ChatGPT said:
Great question! The role of Verisign comes from how the domain registration system is structured. Let me explain how it all fits together.

The Three Layers of Domain Registration
1️⃣ ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)

ICANN is the governing body of the Domain Name System (DNS).
It sets policies and licenses Registries and Registrars, but it does not sell domains directly.
ICANN delegates control of TLDs (like .com, .net, .org) to specific organizations called Registries.
2️⃣ Registry (e.g., Verisign for .com & .net)

A Registry is an organization that maintains the database of all registered domains under a particular Top-Level Domain (TLD).
Verisign is the official Registry for .com and .net, meaning it keeps the authoritative list of all .com and .net domains.
It does not sell domains directly to users—only Registrars can do that.
Other Registries exist for different TLDs:
Afilias (now part of Donuts) → .org
Nominet → .uk
Public Interest Registry → .ngo
3️⃣ Registrar (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains)

A Registrar is a company that sells domains to users and interacts with the Registry on behalf of the customer.
When you buy a domain from GoDaddy, they communicate with Verisign to officially register the domain in the .com database.
Registrars compete by offering different prices, add-on services (email, hosting), and promotions.
How Verisign Came into the Picture?
Originally, Network Solutions (NSI) managed the .com registry and was also a registrar, but this created a monopoly.
In 1998, ICANN was created to introduce competition into the domain industry.
In 2000, ICANN decided to separate Registries and Registrars.
Verisign took over the role of managing the .com and .net Registry, while other companies (like GoDaddy, Namecheap) became Registrars.
How Does a .com Domain Get Registered?
📌 Suppose you register example.com through GoDaddy:
1️⃣ You visit GoDaddy (a Registrar) and search for example.com.
2️⃣ GoDaddy checks with Verisign (the Registry for .com) to see if it’s available.
3️⃣ If available, GoDaddy registers it on your behalf with Verisign.
4️⃣ Verisign updates the .com database to officially link example.com to your details.
5️⃣ You now own the domain, but you must renew it annually through GoDaddy.

Key Takeaways
✅ ICANN sets policies and assigns TLDs to Registries.
✅ Verisign (Registry) manages .com & .net but does not sell domains directly.
✅ Registrars (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.) sell domains to users and interact with Verisign.

does icann charge for these domains
ChatGPT said:
Yes, ICANN charges fees for domain registrations, but not directly to users. Instead, ICANN collects fees from Registrars and Registries as part of its role in managing the DNS system.

How ICANN Makes Money from Domains
1️⃣ ICANN Fees for Registries
Registries (like Verisign for .com, Afilias for .org) pay ICANN an annual fee to operate a Top-Level Domain (TLD).
They also pay a per-domain fee for every domain registered under their TLD.
2️⃣ ICANN Fees for Registrars
Accredited Registrars (like GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains) must pay ICANN an annual accreditation fee (around \$4,000 per year).
ICANN also collects a small per-domain fee (currently \$0.18 per domain) from Registrars when a domain is registered, renewed, or transferred.
3️⃣ Indirect Cost to Users
These ICANN fees are included in the price you pay when buying a domain from a Registrar.
Example: If you buy example.com for \$10 per year, a small part of that cost goes to ICANN.
Example: Cost Breakdown of a .COM Domain
Let's say you register example.com for \$10/year with a Registrar like GoDaddy:

Cost ComponentAmount (Approx.)
Registry Fee (Verisign)~\$7.85
ICANN Fee~\$0.18
Registrar’s Profit & Services~\$2.00
Final Price You Pay\$10.00
Note: Registrars add their own profit margin, which is why domain prices vary between companies.

Key Takeaways
✅ ICANN does not sell domains directly but collects fees from Registries and Registrars.
✅ ICANN charges \$0.18 per domain plus annual accreditation fees.
✅ The cost you pay for a domain includes ICANN fees, Registry fees, and Registrar profit.

from where do these registrars get the domain from
ChatGPT said:
Where Do Registrars Get Domains From?
Registrars do not own domains—they register them on behalf of users by working with Registries that manage specific Top-Level Domains (TLDs). Here’s how the process works:

DNS Domain Registration Process
ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)

ICANN is the global regulatory body that oversees the entire domain name system (DNS).
It authorizes and accredits Registries and Registrars to manage and sell domain names.
Registry (Manages TLDs like .com, .org, .net, etc.)

A Registry is responsible for operating and maintaining a specific TLD.
Example:
Verisign → .com, .net
Afilias (Now Donuts) → .org
Nominet → .uk
Registries keep a central database (WHOIS) of all registered domains under their TLD.
Registrar (Sells Domains to Users)

Registrars (like GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains) act as middlemen between the user and the Registry.
They purchase domain registrations from the Registry and resell them to customers.
They also handle renewals, transfers, and WHOIS record updates.
User (Buys the Domain)

The end user (you) purchases a domain name from a Registrar.
The Registrar communicates with the Registry to officially register the domain.
The Registry updates the WHOIS database to reflect the new ownership.
Example of Domain Purchase Flow
📌 Suppose you want to buy example.com: 1️⃣ You visit GoDaddy (a Registrar) and search for example.com.
2️⃣ If available, GoDaddy contacts Verisign (the Registry for .com) to register it.
3️⃣ Verisign updates the WHOIS database to assign the domain to you.
4️⃣ GoDaddy provides DNS management, email, and hosting services (optional).

Now, your domain is officially registered and points to your website! 🎉

Key Takeaways
ICANN → Governs the entire DNS system.
Registries → Manage specific TLDs and maintain the central database.
Registrars → Sell domains to users and interact with Registries.
Users → Buy and own domains but must renew them periodically.

Here’s a list of all 13 DNS root servers along with their operators:

Root ServerOperator
AVerisign, Inc.
BUSC-ISI (University of Southern California - Information Sciences Institute)
CCogent Communications
DUniversity of Maryland
ENASA Ames Research Center
FInternet Systems Consortium (ISC)

HU.S. Army Research Lab
INetnod (Sweden)
JVerisign, Inc.
KRIPE NCC (Europe)
LICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)
MWIDE Project (Japan)
These root servers are globally distributed using Anycast routing, meaning there are hundreds of instances spread across different locations to ensure redundancy, availability, and faster DNS resolution.

so are root servers just registries
ChatGPT said:
No, Root Servers are not the same as Registries. They serve a completely different function in the Domain Name System (DNS). Let’s break it down:

🔹 What Are Root Servers?
Root Servers are the top-most level of the DNS hierarchy.
They do not store domain names (like example.com) but instead help direct DNS queries to the correct Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers (like .com, .org, .net).
There are 13 sets of Root Servers, operated by different organizations worldwide.
📌 Example of how a Root Server works:
1️⃣ You type example.com in your browser.
2️⃣ Your device asks a DNS Resolver (like Google’s 8.8.8.8 or Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1) for the IP address of example.com.
3️⃣ If the Resolver doesn’t know, it asks a Root Server:

"Hey, where do I find .com domains?"
4️⃣ The Root Server doesn’t know example.com directly, but it tells the Resolver:
"Go ask the .com TLD servers."
5️⃣ The Resolver then asks the .com Registry's nameservers, which direct it to the authoritative nameserver for example.com.
🔹 What Are Registries?
Registries manage TLDs like .com, .org, .net, etc.
They store and maintain all domain names under a particular TLD.
Examples:
Verisign manages .com and .net.
PIR (Public Interest Registry) manages .org.
Nominet manages .uk.
📌 Registries handle:
✔ Selling domains (via Registrars like GoDaddy, Namecheap)
✔ Maintaining authoritative nameservers for their TLD
✔ Managing WHOIS and DNSSEC data

🔹 Key Differences Between Root Servers and Registries
FeatureRoot ServersRegistries
FunctionDirects DNS queries to the correct TLD serversStores and manages domain names under a specific TLD
Data StoredOnly knows TLD locations (like .com, .org)Has the full list of registered domains for its TLD
Who Runs It?12 organizations (ICANN, Verisign, RIPE, etc.)Private companies or organizations (Verisign, PIR, etc.)
ExampleA Root Server tells you where to find .com domainsVerisign (Registry) tells you where example.com is hosted
🔹 Root Servers Are NOT Registries
Root Servers don’t sell domains, manage TLDs, or store full DNS records—they only direct queries to the right TLD servers.
Registries manage specific TLDs and sell domain names via Registrars.

if registries run root zone , how does iana mangeg them
ChatGPT said:
How Does IANA Manage the Root Zone While Registries Run It?
This is a great question! The Root Zone is a critical part of the DNS hierarchy, and while Registries operate TLDs, the IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) is responsible for managing the Root Zone itself. Here’s how it works:

🔹 Understanding the Root Zone & Who Controls It
The Root Zone is the highest level of the DNS and contains information about all TLDs (like .com, .org, .net, .gov, etc.).

The Root Zone is not owned by a single entity, but it is managed through a collaborative structure involving multiple organizations:

1️⃣ ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)

ICANN is the governing body responsible for DNS policies.
It delegates the operational management of the Root Zone to IANA.
2️⃣ IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) – Root Zone Management

IANA (a department of ICANN) manages the Root Zone database.
It keeps an updated list of TLD operators (Registries) and their authoritative nameservers.
It approves changes to the Root Zone (like adding new TLDs or updating Registry information).
3️⃣ Verisign (Root Zone Maintainer)

While Verisign runs the .com Registry, it also has a separate contract to maintain the Root Zone file.
When IANA approves changes (e.g., adding a new TLD like .app), Verisign updates the Root Zone file.
4️⃣ Root Server Operators

The 13 Root Servers (A to M) get an updated copy of the Root Zone file from Verisign.
These Root Servers respond to global DNS queries and point resolvers to the correct TLD Registry.
🔹 Step-by-Step: How IANA Manages the Root Zone
1️⃣ New TLD Creation / Updates
Suppose a new TLD (.cyber) needs to be added.
The Registry (operator of .cyber) applies to ICANN for permission.
ICANN reviews and approves the application.
IANA updates the Root Zone database with the new TLD information.
2️⃣ Updating the Root Zone File
IANA sends approved changes to Verisign, which updates the Root Zone file.
The updated Root Zone file is distributed to all 13 Root Servers.
3️⃣ How Queries Flow Through the Root Zone
When someone types example.cyber:

The DNS resolver asks a Root Server, "Where is .cyber?"
The Root Server checks the Root Zone file and sends the resolver to the correct TLD Registry’s authoritative nameservers.
The TLD Registry directs the resolver to the correct web host for example.cyber.
🔹 Summary: How IANA and Registries Work Together
FunctionIANA (ICANN)Registry (TLD Operator)Root Server Operators

🔹 Key Takeaways
✅ IANA (part of ICANN) manages the Root Zone database and approves TLDs.
✅ Registries operate TLDs, but they depend on IANA to make Root Zone updates official.
✅ Verisign maintains the Root Zone file and distributes updates to Root Servers.
✅ Root Servers direct DNS queries to the correct TLD Registries.
