## Lan (local area network)
Distance doesn’t matter
Ex. If 2 computers are connected through cable over a very long distance

## Wan (wide area network)
If its uploaded on cloud

Why does connection decrease when weather is bad

Hypothetical :
We connect with instagram over lan
Since the isp is not coming in between

![image3](../../attachments/32ab282f31e8440cacd331220d48af52.png)
Wifi to pc is lan
But overall the connection is wan , if we consider isp , wifi and pc
Since isp gives wired connection to router and it creates a local network for us

Wan
Even though everything is connected on wires
The wifi still creates a local network for us
The pc is connected through lan cable or ethernet
