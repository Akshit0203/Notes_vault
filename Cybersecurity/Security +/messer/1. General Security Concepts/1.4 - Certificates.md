## 1.4 - Certificates

### 🔑 What is a Digital Certificate?

- Think of it like an **ID card for websites or people**.
    
- It proves:
    
    1. **Who you are** (identity details)
        
    2. **Your public key** (used for encryption/signature)
        
- It’s based on the **X.509 standard**.

### 🏦 Certificate Authorities (CAs)

- A **Certificate Authority (CA)** is like a government office that issues IDs.
    
- If a CA signs your certificate, people trust you because they already trust the CA.
    
- Example: When you visit a website with HTTPS, your browser checks if the site’s certificate is signed by a trusted CA.

### 📜 Certificate Signing Request (CSR)

How a certificate is created:

1. You (the applicant) make a **key pair** (private + public key).
    
2. You send the **public key** + your details to the CA → this is the **CSR**.
    
3. The CA **verifies your identity**.
    
4. The CA **digitally signs your certificate** and gives it back.
    
    - Now you have a valid digital certificate!

### 🔒 Types of Certificates

- **Public CA certificates** → Issued by big companies (DigiCert, GoDaddy). Trusted worldwide.
    
- **Private CA certificates** → Used inside companies. Devices in the company must trust the internal CA.
    
- **Self-signed certificates** → You sign your own certificate (not trusted outside). Good for testing/internal use.
    
- **Wildcard certificates** → One certificate works for many subdomains (e.g., `*.example.com`).

##3 ❌ Revoking Certificates

Sometimes certificates need to be **cancelled** (if compromised or expired):

- **CRL (Certificate Revocation List):** A list of revoked certificates published by the CA.
    
- **OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol):** A quicker way to check if a cert is revoked.
    
- **OCSP stapling:** The website itself attaches proof of validity in the TLS handshake (faster for browsers).

✅ **In short:**

- Certificates = digital ID cards.
    
- CA = trusted authority that signs certificates.
    
- CSR = request you send to CA to get a certificate.
    
- Revocation = cancelling a bad/expired certificate.


### 🔑 Digital Certificate Explained

A **digital certificate** is like a **passport or driving license** in the digital world.

When you meet someone in real life:

- They show you their **ID card**.
    
- You trust it because it’s issued by a **trusted authority** (like the government).
    

On the internet:

- A **website or person** shows you their **digital certificate**.
    
- You trust it because it’s issued (signed) by a **trusted Certificate Authority (CA)**.

### 🧾 What does it prove?

1. **Who you are (identity details):**
    
    - Name of the organization/person
        
    - Domain name (e.g., `www.bank.com`)
        
    - Sometimes location info (country, company, etc.)
        
2. **Your Public Key:**
    
    - Every certificate includes a **public key**.
        
    - This public key works with the **private key** (kept secret by the owner).
        
    - Together, they allow **encryption** (for privacy) and **digital signatures** (for authenticity).

### 📜 Standard Format → X.509

- Just like passports follow an international standard, certificates follow the **X.509 standard**.
    
- This ensures **every browser, server, and system understands it**.
    

Typical details inside an X.509 certificate:

- Serial Number (unique ID)
    
- Version
    
- Signature Algorithm (e.g., SHA256 with RSA)
    
- Issuer (the CA who issued it)
    
- Subject/Name (the certificate holder)
    
- Public Key
    
- Validity Dates (start & expiry)
    
- Extensions (extra info, e.g., SAN = Subject Alternative Names for multiple domains)

### 🖼 Example Analogy

Imagine:

- You go to an airport.
    
- You show your **passport**.
    
- The officer checks:
    
    1. Your **name & photo** → matches you.
        
    2. The **passport authority stamp** → proves it’s genuine.
        

On the web:

- You connect to `https://example.com`.
    
- Browser checks the **certificate**:
    
    1. **Identity** → "This is example.com".
        
    2. **Digital signature** from a CA → "This certificate is valid and trustworthy".

👉 So, a digital certificate = **An ID card + Public key + Digital signature (from CA)**, all wrapped together.
