passive tags wait for a signal from an RFID reader. The reader sends energy to an antenna which converts that energy into an RF wave that is sent into the read zone. Once the tag is read within the read zone, the RFID tag’s internal antenna draws in energy from the RF waves. The energy moves from the tag’s antenna to the IC and powers the chip which generates a signal back to the RF system. This is called backscatter. The backscatter, or change in the electromagnetic or RF wave, is detected by the reader (via the antenna), which interprets the information.

UHF RFID
Work Frequency Standard ISM 865-867 MHz (IND),865-868 MHz (EU), 902-928 MHz (US)
Air Interface Protocol ISO18000-6B, EPC Class 1 Gen2 (ISO18000-6C)

UHF (Ultra-High Frequency) RFID Tags:
UHF RFID tags operate in the frequency range of 860-960 MHz, allowing for longer read ranges and faster data transfer rates. They are commonly used in logistics, supply chain management, and inventory tracking due to their ability to handle a large number of tags simultaneously.

Understanding the different types of RFID tags is vital for comprehending the intricacies of FASTag and its impact on toll collection systems. Passive, active, semi-passive, and UHF RFID tags each possess unique characteristics that make them suitable for various applications. In the context of FASTag, passive RFID tags play a central role in enabling seamless toll collection, exemplifying the efficiency and convenience of RFID technology.
