| `Firewalls`                                                | Act as barriers between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks, filtering traffic based on predetermined security rules.                                                   |
| `Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems` (`IDS`/`IPS`) | Monitor network traffic for suspicious activities and take automated actions to detect or block potential threats.                                                                            |
| `Virtual Private Networks` (`VPNs`)                        | Provide secure, encrypted connections over public networks, ensuring data privacy and integrity during transmission. For example, used by employees to connect to internal network resources. |
| `Access control mechanisms`                                | Include authentication and authorization protocols to ensure only legitimate users can access network resources.                                                                              |

## Application Security

The primary goal is to ensure that applications are developed, deployed, and maintained in a manner that preserves the confidentiality, integrity, and availability ([CIA Triad](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/cia-triad)) of the data they process and the systems they interact with.

#### 1. Start Building the House (Develop the App)

- `Locks on doors and window`s: When you create an app, you need to make sure only the right people can get in (authentication), like how a house needs good locks to keep strangers out.
    
- `Strong walls and materials`: The app's code should be solid and free from weaknesses that hackers could exploit, just like you would build a house with strong materials to prevent it from collapsing.
    
- `Waterproof roof`: Encrypting data means protecting sensitive information, like making sure your house’s roof doesn’t leak during rain. This ensures no one can read or steal your data while it's being transferred.

#### 2. Inspect the House for Weak Spots (Test for Vulnerabilities)

- `Test if locks are working`: This is like testing an app to see if hackers can break in by trying different methods (penetration testing).
    
- `Look for cracks in walls`: Just as you’d inspect a house for any cracks, developers need to check their app’s code for bugs or weak spots that could be used by attackers.
    
- `Test roof with water`: After you’ve built the app, you need to make sure sensitive data stays protected, just like testing a roof to ensure it doesn't leak during a storm.
    

#### 3. Keep the House Safe Over Time (Ongoing Security Monitoring)

- `Install security cameras`: Even after building and testing your app, you must monitor it regularly to catch any new threats or problems, just like using security cameras to watch for intruders.
    
- `Fix cracks and replace broken locks`: Apps need regular updates to fix vulnerabilities or bugs, just like how you would repair cracks or replace broken locks to keep a house safe.


One key approach is called `Security by Design`, which means that security isn't something you think about later, but rather you build into the app from the start.
