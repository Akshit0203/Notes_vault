Enumeration is the process of extracting usernames, machine names, network resources, shares, and services from a system or network. In the enumeration phase, an attacker creates active connections with the system and sends directed queries to gain more information about the target. The attacker uses the information collected using enumeration to identify vulnerabilities in the system security, which help them exploit the target system.
