CIA Triad

confidentiality , integrity , availability

Confidentiality - ensures information is accessible to only authorized user . To protect the sensitive information from reaching the wrong hands . Ex encryption

Integrity - maintains the correctness or accuracy of the information while the data is in transit , storage or processing , guarantee's that information is trust worthy and not tampered . Ex, RSA digital signature , SHA1 hash codes

Availability - information should be available to authorized persons when it is requested for

AAN

Authenticity - data doesn’t get corrupted or quality doesn’t degrade . Ex photo size gets reduces to half .

Auditing and Accountability - logs on server side , when logged in when logged out. Doesn't get deleted from the server

Reputation - sender and receiver doesn’t deny

Hacking Vocabulary

Hack value - found some bug or exploit whose value is there
Vulnerability - weakness found in a system
Exploit - using vulnerability
Threat - types of attack
Payload - set of malicious code
Zero day attack - finding a vulnerability which hasn’t been found before
Doxing - spamming messages/bullying

2 things requires in hacking - network and host

Threat categories

Network threats
Information gathering
Sniffing
MITM - man in the middle attack
DOS and DDOS
Password based attacks
Firewalls and IDS
Session hijacking

Host threats
Password cracking
Malware attacks
Footprinting
Profiling - users email , dob , address
Backdoor address

5 steps of hacking
1.  Information gathering - foot printing/recconance
2.  Scanning
3.  Gaining access
4.  Maintaining access
5.  Clear tracks

Footprinting
Active - direct attack by attacker
Passive - done attack by spoofing

Scanning
Port
Firewall
Service versions

Gaining access
Ports found open in scanning , gaining access into them

Maintain access
Backdoor access
Trojan access

Clear tracks
Deleting logs created in victims machine

DNS records
A - ipv4 information
AAAA - ipv6 information
Cname - redirects one domain to other domain
MX - mail server
Txt - helps to capture text file
NS record - name server record , websites record
SOA - store information about admin

Footprinting helps to
1.  Know security posture
2.  Reduce attack areas
3.  Identify vulnerability
4.  Draw network map

What can we find while footprinting
Subdomains
E mails
Dns information
Accessible systems
Websites
Vpn information
Firewall vendors
Ids system
