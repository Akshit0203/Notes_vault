# What is AI and Where It's Used

- AGI with narrow objectives is called artificial intelligence (AI)
    
- AI examples mentioned:
    
    - Identifying objects in images (apple vs. orange)
        
    - Email spam classification
        
    - Writing computer code
        
    - Predicting used car prices
        
- AI is present in everyday life, often unnoticed
    

# Why AI is Important

- AI needed due to overwhelming data volume—humans can't keep up

    - Reducing/eliminating routine tasks (e.g., credit card approval, loan processing, insurance claims, product recommendations)
        
    - Acting as a "smart friend"—creating stories, poems, designs, code, music, humor
