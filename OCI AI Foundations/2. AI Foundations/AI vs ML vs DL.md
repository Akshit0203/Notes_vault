## Artificial Intelligence (AI) Overview

- AI described as creating machines or systems that perform tasks requiring human intelligence
    
- Example given: self-driving car making decisions like a human driver (navigating traffic, detecting pedestrians, safe lane changes)
    

## Machine Learning (ML) Basics

- ML introduced as a subset of AI focused on developing algorithms that enable machines to learn from data
    
- Spam email filter used as a relatable example (learning from user interaction and email content)
    
- Explanation of algorithms: set of rules or mathematical procedures for learning and making corrections
    

## Deep Learning (DL) Introduction

- DL explained as a subfield of ML using neural networks with many layers
    
- Example: image recognition software identifying objects or animals in photos
    
- Neural networks described as layers of connected “neurons” learning complex patterns
    

## Types of Machine Learning

- Supervised learning: algorithm learns from labeled data to make predictions or classifications
    
- Unsupervised learning: algorithm discovers patterns in unlabeled data (clustering, dimensionality reduction)
    
- Reinforcement learning: agents learn by interacting with environment and receiving rewards or feedback
    

## Supervised Learning Example

- Credit card approval process used to illustrate supervised learning
    
    - Data collected: application, documents, credit score, approval timeline
        
    - Traditional approach: manual or rules-based decisions, slow and requires skilled people
        
    - ML approach: model trained on past approval data to predict new outcomes
        
- Emphasis on learning from labeled examples (past data)
    

## Unsupervised Learning Example

- Retail company clusters customers based on household size, income, location, occupation
    
    - Used for marketing and sales targeting
        
- Streaming services group users by viewing habits (sessions, unique shows watched)
    
- Nutritional data of fruits and vegetables clustered to find similarities for dietary planning
    

## Reinforcement Learning Overview

- Learning process compared to playing chess: making moves, receiving feedback, remembering outcomes
    
- Used in autonomous driving and robotics
    
- Focus on trial and error learning to maximize rewards
    

## Deep Learning and Neural Networks

- Deep learning extracts features and rules directly from raw data (e.g., pixels in images)
    
- Neural networks described as stacked “brain cells” (neurons) that learn from data
    
- Functional approximation: estimating hidden functions from known data
    

## Generative AI

- Generative AI creates content like text, audio, and images
    
- Models learn patterns from existing data to generate new, creative outputs
    
- Example: ChatGPT generating text responses based on training data
