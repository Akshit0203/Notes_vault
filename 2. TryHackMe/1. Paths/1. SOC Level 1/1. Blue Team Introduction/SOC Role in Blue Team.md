## Security Hierarchy

### Security Hierarchy

Cyber security priorities are different for every company. For law firms, the goal is the privacy of the legal documents. For factories, the availability of production lines. For hospitals, patient safety. That's why every company has a unique security approach and security team structure. Let's take a look at the high-level example of it:

![A diagram of security leadership: Technical employees like SOC analysts have a department manager who reports to CISO and ultimately to CEO.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/678ecc92c80aa206339f0f23/room-content/678ecc92c80aa206339f0f23-1756329066210.png)

Looking at the diagram above, top executives like the CEO usually focus on global business objectives and don't manage technical aspects. That's why they hire a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or a similar role who knows the business needs and can create the most suitable security departments.

### Security Departments

In tiny companies, the IT department takes the role of securing the company. Small to medium-sized companies may have a generic "Information Security" team that does all sorts of tasks.we will focus on bigger companies with a CISO overseeing multiple security teams, each handling a specific task. For example:

- **Red Team**: Offensive security experts, pentesters, or ethical hackers who look for security issues
- **GRC Team**: Specialists managing policies and ensuring compliance with regulations like [PCI DSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard)
- **Blue Team**: Defensive security experts like SOC analysts, engineers, or incident responders

## Meet the Blue Team

Blue Team is about defensive security, meaning it constantly monitors for attacks and tries to respond to them quickly. Depending on a company's size and sector, Blue Team can include a lot of different roles and subdepartments, usually counting 3 to 50 members total.
### Security Operations Center (SOC)

SOC is the central hub for an organization's cyber security - they are the first line of defense, work with various alerts, and handle most attacks. an efficient SOC is usually composed of the following roles:
- **L1 Analysts**: Junior members who triage alerts and pass complex cases to L2
- **L2 Analysts:** Experienced members who investigate more advanced attacks
- **Engineers**: Experts in configuring security tools like EDR or SIEM
- **Manager**: A person who manages the whole SOC team

### Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT)

All members work together to support SOC and respond to critical incidents.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/678ecc92c80aa206339f0f23/room-content/678ecc92c80aa206339f0f23-1756425129228.svg)

If SOC expertise is not enough or the incident goes out of control, you urgently call the "firefighters" - CIRT, also called CSIRT or CERT. The members should have a broad knowledge of cyber threats and handle breaches without depending on tools like EDR or SIEM. A CIRT job is stressful and responsible, but also rewarding. Here are a few CIRT examples:
- [JPCERT](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english): Japan's CERT handling nation-wide breaches
- [Mandiant](https://www.mandiant.com/): A private team responding to global cyber incidents
- [AWS CIRT](https://aws.amazon.com/security-incident-response): Investigates security incidents of AWS customers

### Specialized Defensive Roles

Large companies, technology-focused startups, and government agencies often require narrow and specialized Blue Team roles - exciting and highly valuable, but requiring deep topic knowledge and broad experience in broader fields like SOC or IT. These narrow roles can include:

- **Digital Forensics Analyst**: Uncover hidden threats in disk and memory
- **Threat Intelligence Analyst**: Gather data about emerging threat groups
- **AppSec Engineer**: Maintain a secure software development lifecycle
- **AI Researcher**: Study AI threats and how to defend against them

## Advancing SOC Career

### Internal SOC vs MSSP

Not every organization has the expertise to operate a SOC on its own and relies on a Managed Security Services Provider (MSSP), a company that delivers outsourced security services, most commonly SOC, to its clients. Working at MSSP is typically high-pressure, but it is also a good option to quickstart your career. While we recommend applying for any open SOC position as your first job, it's also important to understand the differences:

|Topic|Internal SOC|MSSP|
|---|---|---|
|**Scenario  <br>Example**|You work in a SOC team of the bank and protect the bank's systems|You work for a global MSSP protecting its sixty customers in Europe|
|**Working  <br>Pace**|You usually have calm shifts without too much time pressure|Your shift usually starts from a queue of urgent alerts to analyze|
|**Security  <br>Tools**|You work with just a few tools, but need to know them very well|You have to work with sixty diverse security tools and platforms|
|**Incident  <br>Practice  <br>**|You saw and learned from just two major cyber attacks last year|Every week, you deal with attacks and breaches, and can learn from it|
### Next Steps

Your most natural next step after L1 is to become a SOC L2 analyst, but you are free to choose another path! While handling a SIEM alert, you might notice that engineering work appeals to you more. During a cyber attack, you may be fascinated by CIRT actions. You may also find yourself well-suited as a manager and build your path to the CISO role. No matter what, your first year or two is to get real work experience, and to spend this time effectively, follow the tips below!
