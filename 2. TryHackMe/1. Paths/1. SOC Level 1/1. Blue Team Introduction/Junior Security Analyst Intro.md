## Junior Security Analyst Journey

As a Junior Security Analyst, also called a SOC Level 1 Analyst, you work in a 24/7 SOC team and mostly review the security alerts together with your colleagues. To do it efficiently, you will need practice and skills learned through this path. During your work shift, you would typically:

- Monitor and investigate various security alerts
- Participate in SOC brainstorms and workshops
- Cooperate with other teams to keep your company safe
- Constantly learn and discover new attacks and defenses

## Security Operations Center (SOC)

**Senior Analyst**
He helps you and other Junior analysts when something is unclear and handles complex cases after you do the initial analysis.

**SOC Engineer**
doesn't have shifts and doesn't analyze the alerts. Instead, he maintains security tools and 
configures the alerts to make your analyst's job easier.

**SOC Manager**
tries to keep everything under control. Reports SOC results to the top management and makes sure you aren't lost in that big new cyber security world.

**Incident Responder**
You don't work with him every day, but when he's online, you know something serious has happened. He is called on demand during major incidents.

Along the way, you'll have many lessons and challenges, where you may:
- Detect and prevent a data stealer infection on a coworker's laptop
- Analyze and stop a phishing campaign targeting the finance team
- Participate in a bigger incident, such as a full-scale ransomware attack
- Team up with your teammates to build detection rules and automations
- Go beyond cyber and understand how companies operate from the inside

## A Day in the Life of a Security Analyst

Being in the defensive frontline is not easy, as you have to constantly learn new things. During a busy 8-hour shift, you might be buried under a mountain of "tickets" - the alerts and tasks that you need to resolve in a timely manner. Still, the job is fun and rewarding, especially after you stop a real threat from damaging your organization. Even better, it is fascinating to know how the attacks you hear about in the news actually happen in the real world.
