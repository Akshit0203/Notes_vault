## Task 2 Core Metrics

The L1 analysts' role in this process is to reliably report True Positives to the higher level, to L2.
This leads us to the first four metrics:

|Metric|Formula|Measures|
|---|---|---|
|Alerts Count|`AC = Total Count of Alerts Received`|Overall load of SOC analysts|
|False Positive Rate|`FPR = False Positives / Total Alerts`|Level of noise in the alerts|
|Alert Escalation Rate|`AER = Escalated Alerts / Total Alerts`|Experience of L1 analysts|
|Threat Detection Rate|`TDR = Detected Threats / Total Threats`|Reliability of the SOC team|

### Alerts Count

Imagine starting your shift and seeing 80 unresolved alerts in the queue. That's definitely overwhelming and prone to missing real threats hiding behind the noise spam. On the other hand, consider a whole week without any alerts. Sounds better at first glance, but also concerning since a too low count of alerts may indicate an issue in the SIEM or lack of visibility, leading to undetected breaches. The ideal metric value depends on company size but in general, **5 to 30 alerts per day per L1 analyst is a good metric**.

### False Positive Rate

If 75 out of 80 alerts (94%) were confirmed to be False Positives like system noise or typical IT activity - that's a bad signal for your team. With more noise, analysts tend to become less vigilant and more likely to miss the threat and treat all alerts just like "yet another spam". A False Positive rate of **0% is an unachievable ideal, but 80% or higher is a serious problem**, usually fixed by a tool and detection rules tuning, often called "False Positive Remediation".

### False Positive Rate

If 75 out of 80 alerts (94%) were confirmed to be False Positives like system noise or typical IT activity - that's a bad signal for your team. With more noise, analysts tend to become less vigilant and more likely to miss the threat and treat all alerts just like "yet another spam". A False Positive rate of **0% is an unachievable ideal, but 80% or higher is a serious problem**, usually fixed by a tool and detection rules tuning, often called "False Positive Remediation".

### Threat Detection Rate

Imagine that out of six attacks for 2025, your SOC team detected and prevented four attacks, missed the fifth because of the broken detection rule, and the sixth because one of the L1 analysts misclassified the breach as False Positive. The resulting metric is TDR = 4 / 6 = 67%, and this is a very bad result. The threat detection rate **should always be at 100%** since every missed threat can have devastating consequences, such as ransomware infection and data exfiltration.

## Task 3 Triage Metrics

an alert by itself will not stop the breach, and it is important to timely receive the alert, triage it, and respond to the attack before the attackers achieve their goals.

The requirements to ensure a quick detection and remediation of the threat are commonly grouped into a **Service Level Agreement (SLA)** - a document signed between the internal SOC team and its company management, or by the managed SOC provider (MSSP) and its customers. The agreement usually requires quick threat detection (measured by **MTTD**, timely alert acknowledgement by L1 analysts (measured by **MTTA**), and finally, prompt response to the threat, like isolating the device or securing the breached account (measured by **MTTR**):

|Metric|Common SLA|Description|
|---|---|---|
|SOC Team Availability|24/7|Working schedule of the SOC team, often Monday-Friday (8/5) or 24/7 mode|
|Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)|5 minutes|Average time between the attack and its detection by SOC tools|
|Mean Time to Acknowledge (MTTA)|10 minutes|Average time for L1 analysts to start triage of the new alert|
|Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)|60 minutes|Average time taken by SOC to actually stop the breach from spreading|
Mean Time to Response (MTTR) is the average time between the initial alert and response to it (e.g. malware removal, password reset, or system restore).

## Task 4 Improving Metrics 

the metrics are often used to evaluate your performance, and good results lead to career growth and a raise to more senior positions like L2 analyst.

| False Positive Rate  <br>over 80%         | **Your team receives too much noise in the alerts. Try to:**  <br>  <br>1.

| Mean Time to Detect  <br>over 30 min      | **Your team detects a threat with a high delay. Try to:**  <br>  <br>1. Contact SOC engineers to make the detection rules run faster or with a higher rate  <br>2. Check if SIEM logs are collected in real-time, without a 10-minute delay                  |
| Mean Time to Acknowledge  <br>over 30 min | **L1 analysts start alert triage with a high delay. Try to:**  <br>  <br>1.

| Mean Time to Respond  <br>over 4 hours    | **SOC team can't stop the breach in time. Try to:**  <br>  <br>1. As L1, make everything possible to quickly escalate the threats to L2  <br>2.
