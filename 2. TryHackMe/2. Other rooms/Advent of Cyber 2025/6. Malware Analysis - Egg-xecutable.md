Static analysis can be a quick and effective way to understand how the sample _may_ operate, as well as how it can be identified. Some of the information that can be gathered from static analysis has been included in the table below:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Information**|**Explanation**|**Example**|
|Checksums|These checksums are used within cyber security to track and catalogue files and executables. For example, you can Google the checksum to see if this has been identified before.|`a93f7e8c4d21b19f2e12f09a5c33e48a`|
|Strings|"Strings" are sequences of readable characters within an executable. This could be, for example, IP addresses, URLs, commands, or even passwords!|`138.62.51.186`|
|Imports|"Imports" are a list of libraries and functions that the application depends upon. For example, rather than building everything from scratch, applications will use operating system functions and libraries to interact with the OS.<br><br>These are useful, especially in Windows, as they allow you to see how the application interacts with the system.|`CreateFileW`<br><br>This library is used to create a file on a Windows system.|
|Resources|"Resources" contain data such as the icon that is displayed to the user. This is useful to examine, especially since malware might use a Word document icon to trick the user.  <br>  <br>Additionally, malware itself has been known to hide in this section!|N/A|


# **Demonstrating PeStudio**

First, we will use PeStudio to gather information about the executable.  
  
**Executive Summary:**
1. **Launch PeStudio**
2. **Load the executable into PeStudio**
3. **Click on the "indicators" tab in the dropdown**
4. **Look for the SHA256Sum**

First, we will launch PeStudio and load the executable into it.

For us, at this stage, the `**file > sha256**` property within the table is of interest. This value is a checksum, which is a unique identifier for the executable. We can keep a note of this SHA256 as threat intelligence.

Next, we will proceed with reviewing the "Strings" of the executable. You can do this by clicking on the "strings" indicator on the left pane of PeStudio.

![Viewing the "strings" within an executable](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00-1762522282733.png)

In the context of malware analysis, strings are sequences of readable characters present within an executable. This could be, for example, IP addresses, URLs, commands, or even passwords! As a malware analyst, it's great to have a look at these, as these could reveal the attacker's command infrastructure, which we can use for our defences.

# Interactive: Dynamic Analysis

This section of the room provides a brief introduction to dynamic analysis. As you recall, dynamic analysis involves executing the malicious sample to identify its behaviours and how it interacts with the operating system.

**Regshot**

Regshot is a widely used utility, especially when analysing malware on Windows. It works by creating two "snapshots" of the registry—one before the malware is run and another afterwards. The results are then compared to identify any changes.

Malware aims to establish persistence, meaning it seeks to run as soon as the device is switched on. A common technique for malware is to add a `Run` key into the registry, which is frequently used to specify which applications are automatically executed when the device is powered on.

**Before executing the malicious sample**, `HopHelper.exe`, let's create a snapshot of our registry as it currently is, so we can compare the difference once the sample has been executed.

Let's load up Regshot and create a capture of the registry as it currently exists. The shortcut to this has also been placed on the Desktop of the analyst machine.

First, change the output directory of the capture to the user's Desktop using the box with three dots in the "Output path" section.

Then, once set, let's create our first snapshot. Press **1st shot** and then **Shot** on the dropdown. Please note that this may take a few minutes to complete.

![Configuring the output path and then creating our first registry snapshot](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00-1761323311278.png)

Now that we have taken a snapshot of the registry, you should proceed with **executing the `HopHelper.exe` sample** and take another snapshot. We will then compare the difference.

For you, this is the `HopHelper.exe` executable located in the "HopHelper" folder on your Desktop.

_Psst...now that you have executed the sample, you might see that some strange things have happened._

Once we have executed our sample, let's return to Regshot and capture our second snapshot, using the same procedure as above. Click on the **2nd shot** button and press **Shot** in the dropdown. Regshot is now capturing the registry again, and outputting the differences to a file.

![Using Regshot to create the 2nd snapshot](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00-1761323991947.png)

And now, after a few seconds, let's press the **Compare** button that appears.

![Comparing the results of the difference between the two registry snapshots. The text editor will open after a minute or so.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00-1761323991948.png)

We can search for the executable within the log that opens up. 

**ProcMon**

Next, we will explore using ProcMon (Process Monitor) from the Sysinternals suite to investigate today's sample. Proccess Monitor is used to monitor and investigate how processes are interacting with the Windows operating system. It is a powerful tool that allows us to see exactly what a process is doing. For example, reading and writing registry keys, searching for files, or creating network connections.

Open **Process Monitor (ProcMon)**, the shortcut for this has been placed on the Desktop of the analyst machine. Process Monitor will automatically start capturing events of various processes on the system.

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00-1762516360387.png)

Now, execute the sample **`HopHelper.exe`** again and return to Process Monitor to see how it interacts with the operating system.

You will see a lot of information here. Do not worry, we will come onto how to filter this shortly.

After allowing a minute to pass, ensuring the sample has fully executed, we will now stop capturing. To stop capturing more events, click on the **Play** button in the toolbar of Process Monitor.

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00-1762516393423.png)

As you can see, there is a lot of information to scroll through here, with the most recent events at the bottom. Here we can see how various system processes are interacting with Windows. Nearly all of it, we don't care about. 

Remember, the task content is demonstrating using Process Monitor for the demonstration sample `downloader.exe`.

You will need to follow along, but doing so for the `**HopHelper.exe**`.

Let's apply some filters. Afterall, for this demonstration, we only care about the `downloader.exe` sample. To do so, click on the **Filter** button, and then **Filter** within the dropdown.

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00-1762869222958.png)

A new window will open.

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00-1762516544414.png)

Here we can create some filters to remove some of the noise that we don't care about. Because we want to only look at this `downloader.exe` sample for this demonstration, we can apply a filter like so:

1. Apply the **Process Name** filter
2. Set the condition to **is**
3. Put in the name of the process we wish to see within the text area
4. Press the **Add** button to apply this filter
5. And finally click **OK** to save.

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00-1762516544233.png)

Once done, returning to the main Process Monitor window, we can already see the filter has worked.

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00-1762516627726.png)

Now it is much easier to investigate how the process is interacting with the operating system. Here are some **Operations** that may be of interest to us:

- RegOpenKey
- CreateFile
- TCP Connect
- TCP Recieve

However, as you can see, there is still a lot of information. We can further apply filters to look for specific things that we want to investigate, such as these aforementioned **Operations**.

To do so, return to the **Filter** heading and create the filter we want to apply. For example, we can filter by **Operations**. Let's do so below, filtering for any TCP **Operation**:

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00-1762516627630.png)

We will now see all **Operations** that include **TCP**. Remember, you can remove the filters you've previously applied by pressing the filter in the **Filter** list, and pressing **Remove:**

Or, alternatively, if you wish to start over, you can simply press the **Reset Filter** option when clicking on the **Filter** heading.
