## Defensive Security

AI agents are being used in blue teaming to speed up detection, investigation, and response, making them quicker and more dependable. Acting like automated assistants, these agents continuously process telemetry (logs, network flows, endpoint signals) and add context to alerts. Furthermore, we are witnessing the integration of AI into vendor appliances—such as AI-assisted firewalling and intrusion detection systems.

Beyond just detecting threats, AI can also assist in automating responses. Picture your system automatically isolating an infected device, blocking a suspicious email, or flagging an unusual login attempt — all in real time.

## Offensive Security

AI agents have made a notable impact on offensive security by automating and handling the often very labourious and time-consuming tasks that a pentester might traditionally undertake. 

For example, AI can be a powerful tool in a penetration tester's workflow for reconnaissance and information gathering, from OSINT to analysing noisy scanner outputs and mapping attack surfaces. This allows the pentester to spend more time on the crucial tasks that require a human touch.
