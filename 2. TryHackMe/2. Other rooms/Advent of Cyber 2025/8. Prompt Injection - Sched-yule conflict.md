## Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large language models are the basis of many current AI systems. They are trained on massive collections of text and code, which allows them to produce human-like answers, summaries, and even generate programs or stories.

LLMs have restrictions that prevent them from going beyond their built-in abilities, which limits them. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">They cannot act outside their text box</span>, and their training only lasts up to a certain point in time. Because of this, they may invent facts, miss recent events, or fail at tasks that require real-world actions.
