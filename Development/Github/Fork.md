A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original "upstream" repository.

**Fork is a rough copy.**

for example we want to do open source contributions 

![image-92.png](attachments/image-92.png)

first we search up the repo 

![image-93.png](attachments/image-93.png)

![image-94.png](attachments/image-94.png)

![image-95.png](attachments/image-95.png)
we get to the official repo of express js

now we want to make a copy of this project on our github account
i.e to 'fork' or make a rough copy

![image-96.png](attachments/image-96.png)

![image-97.png](attachments/image-97.png)
we can either copy the master branch only or copy the entire project

![image-98.png](attachments/image-98.png)
then we can go to the files individually and click on edit

![image-99.png](attachments/image-99.png)
edit the file accordingly and commit changes

on our forked repo , we will now get the option to contribute
'open pull request' - is to notify the owner that we are suggesting some changes

![image-102.png](attachments/image-102.png)
now , if we go to the pull request tab
we can see our pull request on top

![image-104.png](attachments/image-104.png)
on owner side , we have options to 'merge pull request' or 'close pull request' or 'add a comment'

![image-105.png](attachments/image-105.png)
we can go to the commit tab to see what all change the person has done
