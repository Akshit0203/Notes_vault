```
git config --global user.name "My Name"
git config --global user.email "someone@email.com"
```
i.e if we dont have multiple github accounts logged in 
we can set a main/global account
which git will use as only email address

```
git config --global user.email "someone@email.com"
```
in a specific repo , in a specific project , we have to do changed from a different account

```
git config --list
```
to see what all we have set up using the above git commands
